# DepthFocus

DepthFocus lets you guide the viewer’s attention with layered blur, animated focus masks, and subtle parallax tilt. It supports cursor-tracked focus, automatic drift, or scroll-tied focus while keeping motion GPU-accelerated through CSS transforms and masks.

## Features

- **4 Motion Presets**: `rackFocus`, `spotlight`, `drift`, `pulseGlow`
- **Multiple Focus Modes**: Cursor-follow, auto drift, or scroll-based positioning
- **Layered Blur Control**: Separate blur ranges for background vs. focused region
- **Parallax Tilt**: Perspective and tilt tied to focus point for depth
- **Glow Accents**: Optional pulse glow that breathes around the focus center
- **Touch Friendly**: Opt-in touch tracking and focus callbacks

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { ReactiveImage } from "reactive-image";

export default function DepthFocusHero() {
  return (
    <ReactiveImage
      variant="depthFocus"
      src="/gallery/portrait.jpg"
      alt="Portrait with animated focus"
      animation="spotlight"
      focusMode="cursor"
      focusSize={280}
      tiltAmount={10}
      glowColor="rgba(255, 196, 143, 0.7)"
    />
  );
}
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `animation` | `"rackFocus" \| "spotlight" \| "drift" \| "pulseGlow"` | `rackFocus` | Motion style for focus/glow behavior. |
| `focusMode` | `"cursor" \| "auto" \| "scroll"` | `cursor` | How the focus point is driven (cursor, auto drift, or scroll position). |
| `blurRange` | `{ min?: number; max?: number }` | `{ min: 1.5, max: 12 }` | Base and maximum blur values for background vs. focus area. |
| `focusSize` | `number` | `260` | Diameter (px) of the sharp focus region. |
| `edgeSoftness` | `number` | `~45% of focusSize` | Feather size for the focus mask edges. |
| `tiltAmount` | `number` | `8` | Max tilt in degrees applied with perspective. |
| `glowColor` | `string` | `"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.52)"` | Color for the glow halo. |
| `parallaxDepth` | `number` | `18` | How far content translates with pointer/scroll movement. |
| `enableTouch` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables touch tracking. |
| `focusClassName` | `string` | `-` | Class for the focused (sharp) image layer. |
| `onFocusStart` | `() => void` | `-` | Fires when focus interaction begins. |
| `onFocusMove` | `(coords: { x: number; y: number }) => void` | `-` | Fires when the focus point updates. |
| `onFocusEnd` | `() => void` | `-` | Fires when focus interaction ends. |

## Animation Presets

- **RackFocus**: Soft foreground clarity while background blurs dynamically around the cursor.
- **Spotlight**: Crisp spotlight mask that follows the pointer; great for hero reveals.
- **Drift**: Slow autonomous drift of focus for ambient visuals or idle states.
- **PulseGlow**: Adds a breathing glow around the focus point for dramatic emphasis.

## Tips

- Increase `focusSize` for hero imagery; reduce it for product detail highlights.
- Pair `tiltAmount` and `parallaxDepth` for stronger depth; lower them for subtlety.
- Use `focusClassName` to add borders/overlays specific to the sharp layer.
