# PanReveal

PanReveal layers two images and animates the reveal so you can stage before/after states, focus on a detail, or create editorial storytelling moments. The variant supports directional slides, circular/elliptic masks, and spotlight reveals that can follow the cursor.

## Highlights

- **Three Animation Families**: `slide`, `mask`, and `spotlight` presets tuned for showcase, compare, and storytelling layouts.
- **Secondary Source Support**: Provide a dedicated `secondarySrc` or reuse the same asset for stylish crops.
- **Cursor & Touch Ready**: Optional cursor following plus touch toggle for on-the-go experiences.
- **Customizable Masks**: Control direction, mask shape, size, gradients, and easing with a few props.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: `onRevealStart`/`onRevealEnd` events make it simple to coordinate captions or analytics.

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { ReactiveImage } from "reactive-image";

export default function HeroReveal() {
  return (
    <ReactiveImage
      variant="panReveal"
      src="/hero-wide.jpg"
      secondarySrc="/hero-detail.jpg"
      alt="Editorial fashion story"
      animation="slide"
      direction="right"
      panAmount={45}
      timing={{ duration: 600, easing: "cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)" }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Animation Presets

### Slide Reveal

Directional slides move the secondary layer in/out of view. Perfect for comparisons and multi-angle showcases.

```tsx
<PanReveal
  src="/studio-front.jpg"
  secondarySrc="/studio-back.jpg"
  alt="Product before/after"
  animation="slide"
  direction="left" // left, right, up, down, diagonal
  panAmount={35} // how far the reveal image travels
  gradientColor="rgba(0,0,0,0.4)"
/>
```

### Mask Window

Mask animations clip the secondary image to a circular, ellipse, or rectangular window that expands smoothly.

```tsx
<PanReveal
  src="/macro-texture.jpg"
  secondarySrc="/macro-zoom.jpg"
  alt="Texture close-up"
  animation="mask"
  maskShape="circle"
  maskSize={55}
  followCursor={false}
/>
```

### Spotlight Follow

Spotlight combines mask + gradient overlays and feels like a guided tour. Enable `followCursor` for an interactive exploration.

```tsx
<PanReveal
  src="/cityscape-wide.jpg"
  secondarySrc="/cityscape-night.jpg"
  alt="City light reveal"
  animation="spotlight"
  followCursor={true}
  maskSize={40}
  gradientColor="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.35)"
/>
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Cursor Tracking & Touch Support

- `followCursor` keeps the mask pinned to pointer coordinates. For accessibility, keep the mask large enough (>40%) so keyboard users still benefit.
- Enable touch interactions with `enableTouch`. A tap will trigger the reveal and maintain state until the user taps away.

### Layer Styling Tips

- Use `secondarySrc` for entirely different assets or supply the same `src` with a different crop (e.g., add CSS `object-position`).
- `gradientColor` can be any CSS color; try brand gradients to match marketing art direction.
- Combine with utility classes through `className`/`revealClassName` to add drop shadows, borders, or blend modes.

## API Reference

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `secondarySrc` | `string` | `src` | Image shown during reveal. Falls back to `src` when omitted. |
| `animation` | `"slide" \| "mask" \| "spotlight"` | `"slide"` | Preset that defines the reveal strategy. |
| `direction` | `"left" \| "right" \| "up" \| "down" \| "diagonal"` | `"right"` | Directional slide vector (slide only). |
| `panAmount` | `number` | `35` | How far the reveal image moves (percentage). |
| `maskShape` | `"circle" \| "ellipse" \| "rectangle"` | `"circle"` | Mask geometry for mask/spotlight presets. |
| `maskSize` | `number` | `55` | Mask size percentage for mask/spotlight. |
| `followCursor` | `boolean` | `false` | Makes the mask follow pointer or touch coordinates. |
| `gradientColor` | `string` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.45)` | Accent color used by internal gradient overlays. |
| `timing` | `{ duration?: number; easing?: string; }` | `{ duration: 500, easing: "ease-out" }` | Animation timing configuration. |
| `enableTouch` | `boolean` | `false` | Enables touch handlers for mobile devices. |
| `revealClassName` | `string` | `undefined` | Extra class applied when the reveal state is active. |
| `onRevealStart` | `() => void` | `undefined` | Fired when the reveal animation begins. |
| `onRevealEnd` | `() => void` | `undefined` | Fired when the reveal animation finishes. |

## Performance Notes

- Keep `panAmount` below 50% for subtle reveals and to reduce large translations on mobile GPUs.
- Spotlight masks rely on clip-path; avoid stacking too many on a single page for legacy browsers.
- Preload the secondary asset (e.g., using `<link rel="preload">`) if the reveal is critical to the hero experience.
